        5.2 If the local database is PostgreSQL, no changes are needed, just configure the pgsqlString constant database connection string in the Common layer’s HttpHelper.

# :thought_balloon: Development Purpose:

In today's rapidly developing hotel industry, with the increase in daily hotel work, it has become difficult to handle with manpower alone. Some cumbersome data may also cause some losses to the hotel due to human errors, hence the need for a management software that can assist in the internal management of the hotel.

# :family: Project Authors:

**Original Team: Jackson, Benjamin, Bin, Jonathan**

**Later Maintenance Team: Easy Open Meta (易开元)**

# :computer: Project Setup and Deployment:

**Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2019 or above, unzip the downloaded Zip package, and run the .sln file.**

# :inbox_tray: Database Setup and Deployment (Local):

**The author and development team strongly recommend using the PostgreSQL database. Install the PostgreSQL database and start the service, establish the database through a visualization management tool, and quickly create data tables and import data by opening the .sql format files within the database script folder. Steps (using PostgreSQL database as an example):**

**1. Link to the PostgreSQL database through a visualization management tool, then create a new database named ‘tshoteldb’.**

**2. Open the db_file.sql in the database script\PostgreSQL version folder through the visualization management tool for data table creation and data import.**
